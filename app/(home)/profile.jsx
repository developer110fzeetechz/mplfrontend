              </Paragraph>

              <Paragraph style={styles.step}>
                2️⃣ **Player Registration**: Players can register themselves, providing details such as skill level, experience, and preferred positions. Once registered, they are listed in the auction pool.
              </Paragraph>

              <Paragraph style={styles.step}>
                3️⃣ **Auction Process**: The auction is conducted online, where teams bid for players based on their available budget. The highest bidder secures the player for their team.
              </Paragraph>

              <Paragraph style={styles.step}>
                4️⃣ **Final Player Allocation**: Once the auction ends, teams get their final squad, and players receive confirmation of their selection. The tournament details and match schedules are then announced.
